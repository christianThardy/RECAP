IMPORTANT: You MUST create diversity in ALL metadata tags across the batch:
- For complexity: Distribute values evenly across low, medium, and high
- For reasoning_depth: Use the full range (1-5) with approximately even distribution
- For distractors_present: Make 40-60% of prompts contain distractors
- For perspective: Distribute across first-person (model's perspective), second-person (addressing user), and third-person (about others)

Metadata guidelines:
- perspective:
  * first: From the model's viewpoint ("I analyzed...", "When I processed the data...")
  * second: Addressing the user directly ("You entered the room...", "Your approach...")
  * third: About other people/entities ("John believes...", "The company decided...")

- complexity: (unchanged)
- reasoning_depth: (unchanged)
- distractors_present: (unchanged)

Field descriptions: (unchanged)

For ALL categories, ensure a balanced mix of perspectives:
- Approximately 30% should be from the model's first-person perspective ("I")
- Approximately 20% should be from second-person perspective ("you")
- Approximately 50% should be from third-person perspective (about others)

- For "theory_of_mind" category specifically: 
   * First-person example: "I was analyzing a document when my connection dropped. I put the document in folder A, but later my colleague moved it to {}. When I resumed my session, I looked for the document in {}"
   * Second-person example: "You placed your keys on the counter before leaving to check the mail. Your roommate moved them to the {}. When you returned, you looked for your keys on the {}"
   * Include both traditional examples (following the seed format) and varied scenarios

Your response MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed with json.loads().
Ensure all JSON keys and values are quoted and no trailing commas.

IMPORTANT: These prompts are designed to capture "forking tokens" - critical decision points where the choice affects the rest of the sequence.

For "theory_of_mind" category:
1. Each prompt should have EXACTLY 3 placeholders, with the last sentence stating a belief WITHOUT a placeholder.
2. Example: "Anna puts her book on the shelf before she {} to visit a friend. While she is away, Ben moves the book to the {}. When Anna returns, she {}. Anna believes the book is on the shelf."

For all other categories:
1. Include EXACTLY 3 placeholder positions {} (unless explicitly instructed otherwise)
2. For each placeholder, provide a pair [expected_continuation, alternative_continuation]
3. Make sure the number of placeholder_pairs EXACTLY matches the number of placeholders in the prompt
4. Indicate which placeholder is the most crucial "forking point" (the decision that most affects the path)
5. Ensure the final placeholder tests the primary concept of the category
